Hi there!

My name is Aidan, and I'm a PhD student studying acoustics at Sorbonne Universit√© in Paris. The subject of my doctoral studies is extending a fast late reverberation model based on the conservation of the wave-stress tensor to three dimensions.

I spend a lot of my time in San Francisco, CA, where I worked as an acoustic engineer at Knowles Electronics / Intelligent Audio. In that capacity, I performed virtual data creation and microphone array optimization for IoT devices, as well as audio DSP research and development.

I earned my Masters degree at [CCRMA](http://ccrma.stanford.edu) in the department of music at Stanford University. You can find some of my projects from my time there [here]({{< ref "projects.md" >}}).
