Hi there!

My name is Aidan, and I'm an acoustic engineer based in San Francisco, CA. Currently, I work on virtual data creation and microphone array optimization at Knowles Electronics.

Previously, I studied at [CCRMA](http://ccrma.stanford.edu), where I earned my Masters. You can find some of my projects [here]({{< ref "projects.md" >}}).
