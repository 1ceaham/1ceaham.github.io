Lower bound on frequency validity of energy-stress tensor based diffuse sound field model. Aidan Meacham, Roland Badeau, Jean-Dominique Polack. Presented at and published in the proceedings of ICA (Aachen, 2019).
A lower bound on the frequency validity limit is established for an energetic wave equation derived from the energy-stress tensor, examined in the one-dimensional case [Dujourdy et al, Acta Acustica united with Acustica 103:480-491, 2017]. In practice, the bound is encountered when determining the absorption and diffusion coefficients by iteratively approaching the temporal and spatial decay of measured data.</description>

      <description>Hi there!
My name is Aidan, and I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student studying acoustics at Sorbonne Université in Paris. The subject of my doctoral studies is extending a fast late reverberation model based on the conservation of the wave-stress tensor to three dimensions.
I spend a lot of my time in San Francisco, CA, where I worked as an acoustic engineer at Knowles Electronics / Intelligent Audio. In that capacity, I performed virtual data creation and microphone array optimization for IoT devices, as well as audio DSP research and development.</description>
