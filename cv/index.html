<p><strong><em>Toward Three-Dimensional Computation of the Acoustic Energy-Stress Tensor.</em>
Aidan Meacham.
PhD Thesis, Sorbonne Université (2021).</strong></p>

<p>The energy-stress tensor method is a theoretical approach to approximating the energetic contours of the &ldquo;stochastic reverberation&rdquo; using continuity equations between acoustical energy density, sound intensity, and momentum flux.
These quantities may all be collected in a single tensor called the energy-stress tensor, which represents the connection between invariants in the acoustic field and the conservation equations relating its terms.
This approach was previously demonstrated to be capable of representing the diffuse field in spaces that could be characterized as being one- or two-dimensional with respect to the characteristic length of the tensor quantities, such as a hallway or a floor of an office building.
The thesis aims to extend these findings by a number of avenues: checking the frequency validity of previously derived models, introducing a source term and redefining the model in terms of a finite volume time domain (FVTD) approach, auralizing the results in the context of a hybrid acoustical model, and finally, providing a framework to explore the behavior of the tensor in larger three-dimensional spaces.
Temporally and spatially averaged values of the tensor may be calculated directly in terms of the acoustic velocity potential in a pressure-velocity FVTD simulation, giving preliminary information regarding possible assumptions for future models without requiring exhaustive physical measurement.
This may be used in future work to characterize simulation parameters in terms of geometry and materials properties rather than physical measurements.</p>

<p><strong><em>Auralization of a Hybrid Sound Field using an Energy-Stress Tensor Based Model.</em>
Aidan Meacham, Roland Badeau, Jean-Dominique Polack.
Presented at and published in the proceedings of Forum Acusticum (eConference, 2020).</strong></p>

<p>We propose one strategy for generating an auralizable stochastic field from energy envelopes generated by the energy-stress tensor model. Then, to synthesize a realistic impulse response, the direct path, early reflections, and low frequency portion of the sound field are calculated separately and combined with the stochastic portion to form a hybrid scheme. In this work, we suggest the use of a typical pressure-velocity wave-based scheme and the image source method to generate the non-stochastic sound field components.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lower bound on frequency validity of energy-stress tensor based diffuse sound field model.</em>
Aidan Meacham, Roland Badeau, Jean-Dominique Polack.
Presented at and published in the proceedings of ICA (Aachen, 2019).</strong></p>

<p>A lower bound on the frequency validity limit is established for an energetic wave equation derived from the energy-stress tensor, examined in the one-dimensional case [Dujourdy et al, Acta Acustica united with Acustica 103:480-491, 2017]. In practice, the bound is encountered when determining the absorption and diffusion coefficients by iteratively approaching the temporal and spatial decay of measured data.</p>

<p><strong><em>Implementation of sources in an energy-stress tensor based diffuse sound field model.</em>
Aidan Meacham, Roland Badeau, Jean-Dominique Polack.
Presented at and published in the proceedings of ISRA (Amsterdam, 2019).</strong></p>

<p>An implementation of acoustic sources is developed in the context of an energetic wave equation derived from the energy-stress tensor, examined in the one-dimensional case [Dujourdy et al, Acta Acustica united with Acustica 103:480-491, 2017]. Compared to initial condition formulations, an explicit source term enables realistic modeling of complex sound sources with the possibility of spatial changes in time.
A finite volume time domain (FVTD) approach is utilized to lay the groundwork for future extensions to three dimensions.</p>

Presented at and published in proceedings of NIME (Brisbane, 2016).</strong></p>

<p>Designed and implemented digital instrument leveraging laptop cameras as a tracking device for the opening and closing of a laptop lid, an analog for the squeezing of an accordion bellows.</p>

<p><strong><em>Digital Waveguide Network Reverberation in Non-Convex Rectilinear Spaces.</em>
Aidan Meacham, Lauri Savioja, Sara R. Martin, Julius O. Smith, III.
AES eBrief, presented at 141st AES Convention (Los Angeles, September 2016).</strong></p>
